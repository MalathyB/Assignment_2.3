1. Each component of Hadoop 1.x

    * Hadoop System is a Master-Slave architecture
    *  Hadoop 1.x file system has 64 MB block size
    * The default replication factor in Hadoop is 3
    * There are total 5 components in Hadoop 1.x architecture
      - Name Node (NN)
      - Data Node (DN)
      - Secondary Name Node (SNN)
      - Job Tracker (JT)
      - Task Tracker (TT)
    * Name Node, Data Node and Secondary Name Node are called as Storage components in Hadoop
    * Job Tracker and Task Tracker are called as Processing components in Hadoop
    * Name node is a Master Node in Hadoop
    * Data Node is the slave nodes in Hadoop.
    * Master Node's MR component is called as Job Tracker
    * Slave Node's MR component is called as Task Tracker.
    * Namenode:
       - Name node decide how to store the phisical location of ech and every file in blocks in the cluster
       - It also manages the metadata of the files stored in data nodes
       - It always stores the metadata in FSImage and EditLogs file at regular intervals
       - This process is called as checkpoint mechanisum
    * Datanode:
       - Data node will store the file data in blocks, as per the instructions from Name node
       - Data node will send the RPC signal at regular interval, to notify the Name node that it is alive and working
       - Data node is also called as Heart beat mechanism
    * Secondary name node:
       - Secondary Name node acts as a backup for Name node
       - It stores the meta data information from Name node at regular interval as per checkpoint mechanism
    * Job Tracker:
       - Job Tracker most of the times resides in the same node as of Name Node
       - It's job is to assign the task to the Data nodes/Task trackers
       - It also decides the job scheduling for the data nodes/Task trackers
       - In case of Job failure, Job tracker decides about the rescheduling of the task on some other nodes
       - Job Tracker is also called as Single Point of Failure ( SPOF)
    * Task Tracker:
       - Its job is to execute the task assigned by job tracker
